{ This Python code defines a class `SpmHistoryEndHostHistoryGridRemote` that inherits from `RemoteModel`. The class represents a table of historical data for end hosts within a specified time range. It includes various attributes such as host IP address, device information, interface details, VLAN information, network view details, and MAC address. The `properties` tuple lists the specific attributes that are available for retrieval from instances of this class. The purpose of this code is to provide a structured representation of end host history data for further processing or analysis, leveraging the defined attributes for each entry in the table. } [/INST] { from ..remote import RemoteModel
