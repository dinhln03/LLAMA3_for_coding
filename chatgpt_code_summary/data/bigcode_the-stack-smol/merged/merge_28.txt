{ This Python program determines the size of an object in bytes. It first imports the sys module for system-specific parameters and functions. Then, it prompts the user to input an object. The code calculates and displays the size of the entered object in bytes using the `sys.getsizeof()` function. Finally, it prints the result showing the size of the object in bytes. By running this code, users can easily find out the memory footprint of a specified object in Python. } [/INST] { #Python program to get the size of an object in bytes
import sys
Object = input("Enter any object: ")

print(f'The size of the object {Object} is {sys.getsizeof(Object)} bytes') }
