{ This Python code snippet demonstrates the usage of a function decorator named `interpolate_doc` for generating documentation. 

- The `interpolate_doc` decorator interpolates specific variables and a class attribute into the function's docstring before the function is defined.
- A docstring format includes placeholders like `{interpolate_example.foo}`, `{bar}`, and `{Foo!K}` to insert the values of the `foo` variable, `bar` variable, and the special class attribute `__kw__` from class `Foo` into the function `func`'s docstring.
- There is a demonstration of catching an error when a docstring is improperly formatted within the `bad_doc` function. } [/INST] { from interpolate import interpolate_doc


foo = """
    hello
    world
"""
bar = "foo bar\nbaz"


class Foo:
    # cf matplotlib's kwdoc.
    __kw__ = "the kw of foo"


@interpolate_doc
def func():
    """
    this is a docstring

    {interpolate_example.foo}

        {bar}

    {Foo!K}
    """


try:
    @interpolate_doc
    def bad_doc():
        """
        fields {must} be preceded by whitespace
        """

    print("error correctly caught") }
