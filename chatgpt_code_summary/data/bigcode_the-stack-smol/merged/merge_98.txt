{ This Python code snippet imports various utility functions from a module named "util." The functions include calculating Root Mean Square (rms), moving average, moving average with convolution, moving average with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), normalization, finding the next power of 2, trimming top and tail elements, extrapolation, nearest neighbor search, handling deprecated functions, applying a function along an axis, sigmoid function, power function, and root function. These functions help in data processing, signal analysis, and mathematical operations. } [/INST] { from .util import rms
