{ This Python program simulates the Josephus problem: N soldiers stand in a circle, and one kills the next soldier, passing a sword until only one survives. The code defines a function `josephus` taking the number of soldiers and an optional step size. It calculates the survivor using a while loop by eliminating soldiers based on the step size. The program then prompts the user for the number of soldiers, creates a list representing them, and invokes the `josephus` function with this list. Finally, it determines the surviving soldier and displays the result. } [/INST] { # Problem: N soldiers are standing in a circle and 
 # first person has sword and he kills the 2nd person 
 # and gives the sword to the third person and so on 
 # till 99th person kills the 100th person gives the 
 # sword back to the first person, this goes on till 
 # only one person survives. Print the survivor.

    while(len(people) > 1):
