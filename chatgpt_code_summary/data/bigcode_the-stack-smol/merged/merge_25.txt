{ The provided Python code sets up a Discord bot using the discord.py library. It configures the bot to utilize slash commands and message commands. The bot is initialized with a command prefix "!", and it handles commands like 'ping', 'only_slash', and 'only_message'. The 'ping' command includes an option to use an emoji in the response. The 'only_slash' command is specific to slash commands, while 'only_message' is specific to message commands. The bot logs in, responds to commands, and distinguishes between different types of commands based on parameters provided. To run the bot, replace "token" with your Discord bot token. } [/INST] { import discord

# if your bot is only for a couple of servers, you can use the parameter
# `slash_command_guilds=[list, of, guild, ids]` to specify this,
# then the commands will be much faster to upload.
