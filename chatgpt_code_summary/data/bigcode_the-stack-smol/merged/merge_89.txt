{ This Python script defines a class named "OapiCateringUnfreezeRequest" that extends a base class "RestApi." It includes initialization for attributes like order_id, rule_code, and userid. The class specifies a method to get the HTTP method type as POST and another method to get the API name related to unfreezing catering orders in DingTalk. The purpose of this script is to facilitate making POST requests to the DingTalk API endpoint for unfreezing catering orders, encapsulating the required data and operations within a structured class for ease of interaction with the API. } [/INST] { '''
