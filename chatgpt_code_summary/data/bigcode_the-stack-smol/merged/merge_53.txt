{ This Python code defines a plugin for using a Digital Bitbox hardware wallet in an Electrum wallet environment. It extends functionality from DigitalBitboxPlugin and utilizes a CmdLineHandler. The code includes a method `init_keystore()` that assigns the CmdLineHandler to the keystore for communication. The code checks if the keystore is of a specific class before assigning the handler. It uses the `@hook` decorator to specify when the `init_keystore()` method should be called. This setup ensures that the Digital Bitbox hardware wallet integrates correctly with the Electrum wallet through the defined plugin. } [/INST] { from electrum.plugins import hook
