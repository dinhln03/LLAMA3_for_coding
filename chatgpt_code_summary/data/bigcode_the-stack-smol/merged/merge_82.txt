{ This Python code defines a class `SearchInsertPosition` with a method `searchInsert` that takes a sorted array `nums` and a target value `target`. If the target is found in the array, the method returns the index. If the target is not found, it returns the index where the target would be inserted to maintain the order. 
- If `nums` is empty, it returns 0. 
- It then iterates through `nums` to find the appropriate index for `target` based on its value compared to elements in the array. 
- If the target is not found and should be inserted in between elements, the method returns the index where it should be inserted. } [/INST] { # -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
# Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
#
# You may assume no duplicates in the array.
#
# Here are few examples.
# [1,3,5,6], 5 → 2
# [1,3,5,6], 2 → 1
# [1,3,5,6], 7 → 4
# [1,3,5,6], 0 → 0
