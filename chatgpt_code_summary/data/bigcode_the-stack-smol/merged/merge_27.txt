{ This Python function named `number_of_occurrences` takes two parameters: a string `s` and a list `xs`. It returns the count of occurrences of the string `s` within the list `xs` using the `count` method available for lists in Python. This function essentially calculates how many times the given string `s` appears in the provided list `xs` and returns that count as the output. It can be used to efficiently determine the frequency of a specific element (in this case, a string) within a list. } [/INST] { def number_of_occurrences(s, xs):
    return xs.count(s) }
