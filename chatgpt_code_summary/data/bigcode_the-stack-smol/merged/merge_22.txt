{ This Python code defines a class `Solution` with a method `coinChange` that calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make up a given amount. It uses dynamic programming to iterate through each possible amount and coin denomination to find the optimal solution. The `res` list stores the minimum number of coins needed for each amount. The algorithm iterates through each amount and each coin denomination to update `res` with the minimum number of coins required. If the final result exceeds the given amount, it returns `-1`, otherwise, it returns the minimum number of coins needed for the amount. } [/INST] { class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins, amount):
        """
        :type coins: List[int]
        :type amount: int
        :rtype: int
        """
#         max value taken as amount+1 because in worst case, it can be amount - when denoms of only 1
        res = [amount+1]*(amount+1)
        res[0] = 0
        for i in range(1, amount+1):
