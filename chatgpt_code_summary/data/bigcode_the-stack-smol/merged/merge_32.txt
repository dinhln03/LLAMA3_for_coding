{ This Python script is a test suite for a class called V1alpha1PriorityClass related to Kubernetes. The script imports necessary modules for testing, including the Kubernetes client library. Within the test class `TestV1alpha1PriorityClass`, there is a method `testV1alpha1PriorityClass` set up for testing the `V1alpha1PriorityClass` class. However, the actual test logic is missing, marked with `FIXME`. When executed, this script will run the test case defined in the `testV1alpha1PriorityClass` method. To run this test suite, execute the script which will trigger the defined unit tests. } [/INST] { # coding: utf-8
