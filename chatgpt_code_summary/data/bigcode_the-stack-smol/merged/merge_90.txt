{ This Python code imports the MidiOutputClient class from a file named "client" in the same directory using a relative import (".client"). The comment "# Autogenerated file" suggests that this code is automatically generated and might not need manual modifications. The "type: ignore" comment indicates that type checking or type hinting errors for this import should be ignored. This snippet enables access to the MidiOutputClient class from the client module within the current package, allowing the user to utilize its functionality for MIDI output operations. } [/INST] { # Autogenerated file.
from .client import MidiOutputClient # type: ignore }
