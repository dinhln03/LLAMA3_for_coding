{ This Python script initializes lists for time `t`, lambda `lam`, and letters `com`. It then creates dictionaries `S` and `C` to store values based on combinations of lambda/combinations and time/combinations, respectively. The script calculates the dimensions for a matrix `B_matrix` based on the lengths of the input lists, then populates this matrix with values from the dictionaries `S` and `C` using nested loops. The snippet performs mapping and generates a matrix `B_matrix` filled with values based on specific indices derived from the given combinations of time, lambda, and letters. } [/INST] { # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
