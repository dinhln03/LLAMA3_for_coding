This Python script defines parsers for processing show commands related to DNA Center (DNAC) interfaces. The `InterfaceSchema` class specifies the schema for `/dna/intent/api/v1/interface` and related endpoints. The schema defines various attributes for network interfaces. The `Interface` class inherits from `InterfaceSchema` and acts as the parser for processing the actual show command output.

In the `cli` method of the `Interface` class, it retrieves the output for the specified interface or all interfaces, processes the data, filters out `None` values, and constructs a dictionary containing relevant interface information keyed by the port name.

To summarize, this code segment is part of a framework for parsing and extracting structured data from DNAC interface show commands.
