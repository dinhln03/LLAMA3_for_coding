This Python code defines a custom gate `RZZGate` for a two-qubit ZZ-rotation. It includes methods to create the gate, output it in QASM format, invert it, and reapply it. Additionally, the code provides a function `rzz` to apply the gate to a quantum circuit. The gate can be applied to individual qubits or entire registers simultaneously. The final part of the code extends the `QuantumCircuit` and `CompositeGate` classes to include the `rzz` function. This enables users to apply the custom ZZ-rotation gate to quantum circuits effectively.
