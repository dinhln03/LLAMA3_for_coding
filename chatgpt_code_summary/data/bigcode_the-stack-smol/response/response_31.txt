This Python script defines a `DbClient` class, functioning as a database factory, providing methods for interacting with various types of databases like SSDB, Redis, and PostgreSQL. It includes methods for getting, putting, updating, deleting, and managing data in the database. The script parses the database connection information, initializes the database client based on the type specified, and implements methods to perform database operations using the chosen database client. Users can use this class to interact with different types of databases by creating an instance of `DbClient` and calling its methods for data manipulation and management.
