This Python code snippet configures settings for a Django project. It sets up paths, secret key, debug mode, installed apps, middleware, templates, database, password validation, internationalization, time zone, static files, and the primary key field type. The file structure is established using 'Path' from 'pathlib', and environment variables are accessed using 'decouple'. It is important to keep the secret key secure. Various Django settings like database configuration, password validators, and timezone settings are defined in this script. This code serves as a foundation for developing a Django web application and should be customized per project requirements to ensure proper functionality and security.
