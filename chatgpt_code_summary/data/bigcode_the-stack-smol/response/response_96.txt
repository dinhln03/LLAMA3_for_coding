This Python script uses the argparse module to parse command-line arguments. If the '--list' argument is provided, it executes a subprocess to run a Terraform command and retrieve JSON output. The script then processes this JSON data to extract host information and organize it into a dictionary named 'result'. Each host is linked to its corresponding group, containing details like IP address. Finally, it constructs a JSON structure representing groups, hosts, and their variables. If '--list' is not specified, it outputs an empty JSON dictionary. After executing the script, it generates a JSON output containing groups, hosts, and their associated data.
