This Python script defines constants for bank account types: basic and general accounts. It uses the Flask-Babel extension for internationalization and translation support. The `TYPE_BANK_DICT` dictionary maps account type IDs to their corresponding translated names. The script also creates `TYPE_BANK_SELECT_CHOICES` and `TYPE_BANK_SEARCH_CHOICES` lists by combining default choices with the bank account type choices for selection and search purposes. This code enables developers to work with bank account types in an internationalized way within a Flask application, enhancing user experience and maintainability.
