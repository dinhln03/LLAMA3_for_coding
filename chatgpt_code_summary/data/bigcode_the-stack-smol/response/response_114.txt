This Python code defines a class `TicksValidator` that extends `_plotly_utils.basevalidators.EnumeratedValidator`. It is meant for validating settings related to ticks in a plotting library. The class initializes with parameters for `plotly_name`, `parent_name`, and other optional settings. It sets default values for `edit_type` and `values`, and any additional keyword arguments are also accepted. This class is part of a larger system for validating and handling plot settings, with a focus on color bars and tick settings for histograms and contours.
