This Python script defines functions for migrating a configuration file in a Chromium OS environment. The `SaveNewActiveConfig` function takes a configuration object, serializes it to JSON format, generates an MD5 hash of the JSON string, saves the JSON content to a file with the hashed name in a specific directory, and symlinks it as the active configuration file. The `Migrate` function reads an existing configuration file, removes a specific key ('match') from each 'ruleset', and invokes `SaveNewActiveConfig` to save the migrated configuration. The script helps manage and update configuration files in the Chromium OS factory environment.
