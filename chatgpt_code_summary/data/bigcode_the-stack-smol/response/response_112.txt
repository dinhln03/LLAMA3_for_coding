The code defines a logging system for tracking and visualizing training diagnostics and images in machine learning projects. It consists of different logger classes like TensorboardLogger, LoggingLogger, PlotLogger, and a LoggerManager to manage these loggers.

1. `BaseLogger` is the base class for loggers containing methods for logging diagnostics and images.
   
2. `TensorboardLogger` logs diagnostics and images using the TensorBoard library.
   
3. `LoggingLogger` logs diagnostics to the console and a log file using Python's logging module.
   
4. `PlotLogger` logs and plots diagnostics using matplotlib for visualization.
   
5. `PlotHandler` manages plotting multiple curves from different loggers onto a single plot.

6. `Logger` initializes and manages different loggers based on specified options like Tensorboard, logging, and plotting.

7. `LoggerManager` coordinates multiple loggers for different keys, allowing logging of diagnostics and images, and plotting when needed.
