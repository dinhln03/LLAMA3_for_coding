This Python script defines a command-line tool called "ExtractSkeleton" that extracts the skeleton of a binary object from an input image. The tool allows specifying the type of skeleton (1D or 2D), whether to prune branches, number of points for the skeleton representation, and the file to store skeleton points. The script uses the Nipype library for interface definitions. Additionally, it provides input and output specifications for the tool and includes documentation about its purpose and contributors. The script is not intended to be manually edited and contains information on how to report bugs or contribute to its development.
