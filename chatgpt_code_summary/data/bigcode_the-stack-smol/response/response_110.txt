This Python script is for training an N-styles style transfer model based on pre-trained models. It involves finetuning the instance normalization parameters to stylize images. The script sets up TensorFlow flags for parameters like learning rate, batch size, image size, and model training steps. It loads style images, processes style coefficients, and configures the model's structure. It defines losses, restores VGG16 and N-styles parameters, sets up training with an Adam optimizer, and then runs the training process. The script is designed to be executed from the console for training the style transfer model.
