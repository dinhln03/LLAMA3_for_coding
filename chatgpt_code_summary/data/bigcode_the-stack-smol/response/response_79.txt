This Python code defines a `SpectralCoord` class that handles spectral coordinates and transformations in the astrophysics domain using the Astropy library. The class implements functionality for managing spectral quantities including redshift, relativistic Doppler shifts, and observer transformations. It provides methods to convert between velocities and redshifts, apply relativistic Doppler shifts, update observer positions based on a reference frame, adjust velocities for target and observer, and transform velocities to the rest frame. The code includes error handling for missing velocities and distances. Ensure to have the necessary Astropy library installed to run this code successfully.
