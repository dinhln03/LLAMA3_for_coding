This Python code defines a response class for creating settlement bills in Alipay's financial services. The code extends the `AlipayResponse` class and includes methods to set and get the `result_set` attribute, which contains information about the settlement bill. The `parse_response_content` method parses the response content and populates the `result_set` attribute if it exists in the response. The `result_set` attribute is expected to be an instance of `SettlementbillOpenApiDTO` class or transformed from a dictionary if necessary. This code facilitates handling Alipay settlement bill creation responses by encapsulating the data in a structured manner for further processing.
