This Python script performs image processing using the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter technique. It reads an image, converts it to grayscale, applies the LoG filter with specified kernel size and sigma value for edge detection, and then saves and displays the output image. The code defines functions for converting an image to grayscale (`BGR2GRAY`) and applying the LoG filter (`LoG_filter`). It iterates through the image, computes the convolution, applies padding, applies the LoG kernel, and finally clips the output pixel values to the range [0, 255]. The processed image is then saved as "out.jpg" and displayed.
