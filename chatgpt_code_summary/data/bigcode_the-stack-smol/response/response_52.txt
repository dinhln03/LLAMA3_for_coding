This Python script processes data from a JSON file named 'manifest.json'. It iterates over chains of data, sorts them based on versions, and extracts configuration information. For each chain, it generates a template containing specific fields like Title, Address, and Ports by combining data from wallet and xbridge configurations. It then creates version-specific template data and writes it into separate JSON files based on tickers. The script utilizes ConfigParser to parse configuration files, extracts and organizes data into templates, and finally prints a comma-separated list of tickers processed.
