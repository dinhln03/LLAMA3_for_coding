The provided code is a TensorFlow implementation for a semi-supervised learning method, specifically focusing on VAT (Virtual Adversarial Training). Here's a summary with explanations:

1. The code sets various hyperparameters and flags using TensorFlow's `tf.app.flags` module.
2. Depending on the chosen dataset (`cifar10` or `svhn`), corresponding inputs are imported.
3. Functions are defined to build the training and evaluation graphs incorporating the VAT method.
4. The `main` function executes the training process:
   - Constructs the training and evaluation graphs.
   - Iterates through training epochs, updating the model parameters.
   - Evaluates the model performance on both training and test datasets.
   - Saves the trained model.

Overall, the code initializes the model, performs VAT-based semi-supervised learning, and evaluates the model on specified datasets, optimizing parameters using the `AdamOptimizer`.
