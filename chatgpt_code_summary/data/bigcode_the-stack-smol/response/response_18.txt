This Python code sets up a threaded TCP server that listens for incoming connections on a specific IP address and port. When a client connects, it handles the data received, decodes it, and passes it to a device. If there are any errors during this process, they are logged. The server can add and remove client connections dynamically. To use this code, ensure the necessary libraries are imported, configure the server address and port, and then run the server. Utilize the TCPServer class to manage client connections by adding or removing them as needed. Remember to handle exceptions gracefully.
