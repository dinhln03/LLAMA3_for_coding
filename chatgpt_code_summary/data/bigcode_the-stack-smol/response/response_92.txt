This Python program simulates the Josephus problem: N soldiers stand in a circle, and one kills the next soldier, passing a sword until only one survives. The code defines a function `josephus` taking the number of soldiers and an optional step size. It calculates the survivor using a while loop by eliminating soldiers based on the step size. The program then prompts the user for the number of soldiers, creates a list representing them, and invokes the `josephus` function with this list. Finally, it determines the surviving soldier and displays the result.
