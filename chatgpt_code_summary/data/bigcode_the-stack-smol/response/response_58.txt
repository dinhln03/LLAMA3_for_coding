This Python code extracts vulnerability information for a given application from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The script takes the application name as a command line argument, retrieves search results for vulnerabilities related to that application from the NVD website, extracts Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs, and then for each CVE ID, fetches and extracts Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) information. Finally, it outputs the first CPE information found for the application in the format "{application_name}.tb:{cpe_info}". The code is meant to automate the retrieval and parsing of vulnerability data for a specific application.
