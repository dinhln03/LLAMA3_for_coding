The Python script defines a class `PrebuildLib` with methods for managing cached libraries. The script includes functions to zip, clean, fetch, and apply cached libraries for prebuilding. It also handles checking for changes in libraries, updating the cache, and pushing changes to a Git repository. Additionally, it provides functionality to prebuild and update libraries for development pods. The script logs operations using a logger and makes use of utility functions for file management and Git operations. The primary purpose is to streamline the prebuilding process of libraries and manage their caching effectively to enhance the development workflow.
