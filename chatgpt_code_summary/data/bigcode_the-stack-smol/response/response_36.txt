This Python script contains a series of unit tests for the Zipf distribution in TensorFlow Probability. The code verifies the calculation of probability mass functions, cumulative distribution functions, mean, variance, and sampling for Zipf-distributed variables. It also checks for proper handling of invalid inputs such as non-integer values and negative samples. The tests cover scenarios with both integer and non-integer values, multidimensional inputs, and different data types for the power parameter. The script ensures that the Zipf distribution functions behave as expected and that sampling produces consistent results with the same seed.
