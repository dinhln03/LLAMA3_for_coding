This code defines two models - `LocationFilterModel` and `StudentListFilterModel` with various fields such as `plz`, `distance`, `countrycode`, and `uuid`. It imports necessary modules and fields from Django and generates dynamic fields based on the field type in `StudentJobRequirementsFilter`. If the field type is `NullBooleanField`, a new field is added with the same name. If it is `DecimalField`, an `IntegerField` is added. Similarly, `ChoiceField` results in an `IntegerField` with choices, and `DateField` adds a `DateField` to the model. Any other field type raises a `ValueError`.
