The given Python code defines a class `AnnotationsService` with methods to generate, find, and update annotations. It interacts with different repositories for images, annotations, and fragments. 

- The `generate_annotations` method fetches and processes an image to generate annotations using an AI client.
- The `find` method retrieves annotations by a museum number.
- The class has private methods to handle labeling and cropping images based on annotations.
- The `update` method updates annotations with cropped images, stores them, and logs the changes made by a user.

The code integrates various components to manage and process annotations for archaeological fragments.
