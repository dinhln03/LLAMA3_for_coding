This Python script defines a class `ModelBuilderRLF` that extends `BaseModelBuilder`. The method `get_default_model` within this class initializes and returns a dictionary `p` containing default parameters for a specific machine learning model. The parameters include model name, training grid, ML type, number of jobs, and various model-specific settings such as tree size, sample fraction, max rules, and more. This method encapsulates the default configuration for a RandomLearnerForest (RLF) model in a structured format for further usage and customization.
