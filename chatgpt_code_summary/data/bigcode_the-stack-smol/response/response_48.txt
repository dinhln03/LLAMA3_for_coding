This Python code defines a function to process continuous features for decision tree algorithms. The function takes as input the algorithm type, dataset, column name, entropy value, and configuration. It first sorts unique values and computes statistical attributes like mean and standard deviation. Then, it calculates gains, gain ratios, Gini indices, chi-square values, and standard deviations based on different algorithms. Finally, it identifies the best threshold value for splitting the data and updates the dataset accordingly. The function covers algorithms like ID3, C4.5, CART, CHAID, and Regression, adapting the threshold selection method based on each algorithm.
