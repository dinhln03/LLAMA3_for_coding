This Python script provides a command-line interface to create a style guide for CSS/LESS/SASS. 

1. It imports necessary modules like argparse, logging, pprint, guide, and settings.
2. Defines a CLI function that sets up argument parsing for settings file and log level.
3. Parses the arguments provided by the user, initializes logging with the specified log level, and configures markdown logging if the log level is not DEBUG.
4. Uses the settings file specified by the user or defaults to 'vitalstyles.json' to create a style guide.
5. If the script is executed directly (not as a module), it runs the CLI function to generate the style guide based on the provided settings.
