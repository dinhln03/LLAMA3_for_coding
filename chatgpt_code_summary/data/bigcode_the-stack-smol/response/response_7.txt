This Python script defines a test suite for checking CSS code style using a CSS checker tool. The script includes multiple tests that verify different aspects of CSS code against expected standards. Each test method creates mock CSS files, runs checks using the CSS checker tool, and compares the results to expected outputs. The tests cover rules such as alphabetical property order, single quotes over double quotes in strings, preferred units for measurements, preferred naming conventions for classes and IDs, brace placement, pseudo-element syntax, and more. The script also includes methods to remove specific blocks (like @media and @keyframes) from CSS content for validation purposes. To execute the tests, run the script as the main program triggering the unittest framework.
