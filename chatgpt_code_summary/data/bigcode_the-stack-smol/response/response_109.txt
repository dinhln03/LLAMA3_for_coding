This Python script blends two generative models for image generation at different resolutions. It defines functions to extract convolution names from models and blend the models based on specified criteria. The `create_blended_model` function loads two pre-trained models, blends them using the `blend_models` function, and saves the output model to a specified file. Users can run the script via the command line, providing filenames for the lower and higher resolution models, setting the output path, model resolution, and the split level for model weights. The blended model is saved in the specified location.
