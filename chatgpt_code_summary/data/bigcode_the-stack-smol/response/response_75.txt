The provided Python code consists of two main functions within classes. The `_fit_imaging_from` function creates a `FitImaging` object by processing a `Fit` object and a list of galaxies from a non-linear search. It handles settings for imaging, pixelization, and inversion, and utilizes preloaded data for faster computation. The `FitImagingAgg` class wraps a PyAutoFit aggregator to generate `FitImaging` objects based on the results of a non-linear search model-fit. The `make_object_for_gen` method within this class calls `_fit_imaging_from` with specified settings and generates the final `FitImaging` object.
