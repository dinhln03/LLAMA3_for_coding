This Python script generates a classic linear chirp waveform, applies Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Short-term Fourier Transform (STFT) on the signal, and visualizes the Time-Frequency representations. It also provides options for exporting the generated waveform as a WAV file. The code constructs the chirp signal, calculates CWT and STFT, computes signal-to-noise ratios, and plots the results using specified parameters. The key functionalities include generating synthetic chirp signals, applying signal processing techniques for time-frequency analysis, and displaying the spectrogram representations. The code incorporates various modules for computations, plotting, and signal processing from the `libquantum` library.
