The given Python code defines a Bi-Encoder model and a function for calculating the NLL loss. The Bi-Encoder consists of a question encoder and a context encoder to create pooled embeddings for questions and contexts. These embeddings are then used to calculate similarity scores. The BiEncoderNllLoss class computes the negative log-likelihood loss between question and context vectors based on the similarity scores. The loss is scaled if specified. To use this code, instantiate the BiEncoder class with appropriate encoders, and then utilize the forward method to obtain pooled embeddings. Finally, use BiEncoderNllLoss.calc method to compute the NLL loss.
