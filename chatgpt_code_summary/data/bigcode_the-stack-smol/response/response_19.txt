This Python code defines URL patterns for a Django web application related to managing questions and answers. It sets up routes for various views such as displaying question details, editing questions, adding tags, marking content as spam, flagging content, subscribing by email, etc. The code also includes routes for the feeds of questions and answers. Additionally, it handles actions like voting on questions and answers, locking questions, solving questions, and managing tags. The URLs are structured to facilitate the flow of a question-answer system and incorporate features like marketplace-specific flows and asynchronous interactions.
