This Python code defines a class `ZoneResourceFetcher` with methods to interact with Google Cloud Platform's zones. The `GetZones` method fetches zone resources by making API calls to retrieve information about specific zones. The `WarnForZonalCreation` method checks for upcoming deprecation in specified zones and warns the user about potential resource deletion. The code uses dependency injection to set up the necessary API client and handles error conditions by returning `None` or raising exceptions based on user input. This script is designed to facilitate working with zones in Google Cloud Platform efficiently and safely.
