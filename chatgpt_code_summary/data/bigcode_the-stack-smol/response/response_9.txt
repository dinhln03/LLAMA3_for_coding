This Python script is a web scraper using Scrapy to extract store location data from the Aldi UK website. It defines a spider named AldiUKSpider that fetches store information URLs, then extracts details like store name, address, location coordinates, and opening hours by parsing JavaScript and JSON data from the website. The extracted data is structured into a GeoJSON format and yielded as GeojsonPointItem objects. The script sets specific request headers and cookies for web scraping and handles multiple store locations efficiently. The code demonstrates how to scrape and process structured data from a website using Scrapy in Python for location-based information retrieval.
