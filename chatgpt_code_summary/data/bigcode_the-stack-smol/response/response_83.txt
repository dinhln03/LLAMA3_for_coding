This Python code defines a class for solving inverse kinematics problems. It includes functions for calculating joint angles based on a given transformation matrix, computing specific solutions for different joint angles, and determining the best solution for a given configuration ID. The code uses trigonometric functions and matrix operations to solve for the joint angles of a robot arm. Key methods include `compute_joint_angles`, `get_solution_for_config_id`, `get_best_solution_for_config_id`, `is_valid_solution_by_config_id`, and `get_current_configuration_id`. The code handles various solutions and configurations to find valid joint angles for the robot arm in a 3D space.
