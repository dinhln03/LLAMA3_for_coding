This Python code defines test cases for the `backend_context` module using TensorFlow for handling experiment data in TensorBoard plugin. It involves setting up mock data, creating test cases to check functionality that includes hparam metadata, experiment data, and comparing protobuf objects.

1. The code sets up mock data for testing.
2. Test cases include scenarios like testing experiments with and without specific tags, different hparam types, and distinct values.
3. The code ensures correctness by comparing expected experiment protobuf objects with actual ones.
4. There are helper functions such as `_canonicalize_experiment` to sort repeated fields in protobuf messages.
5. To run the tests, invoke the `tf.test.main()` method.

The purpose of this code snippet is to test the functionality of processing and handling experiment data within the TensorBoard plugin, focusing on hparams (hyperparameters) and metrics.
