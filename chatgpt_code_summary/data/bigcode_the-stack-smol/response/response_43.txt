This Python script defines classes for handling lipid data and filtering precursor ion matches. 

1. `LipidBLAST_entry`: Defines a lipid entry with properties like name, ion type, molecular weight (mw), chemical formula, etc. It contains a method to format the entry for display.

2. `LipidBLAST`: Initializes a lipid database by reading provided files and storing entries. It includes methods to read and store lipid data, simplify lipid names, and calculate chemical formulas for ions.

3. `PrecursorFilter`: Defines a filter for matching precursor ion masses in the lipid database. It retrieves entries based on a given precursor mass and a specified ppm tolerance.

4. The `__main__` section logs information, reads a lipid database, performs precursor filtering on a dataset, and outputs results to an Excel file.

To use this script:
- Ensure all necessary files are available.
- Initialize the `LipidBLAST` class to read and store lipid data.
- Create an instance of `PrecursorFilter` with a specified ppm tolerance.
- Process data using the precursor filter and save the results to an Excel file.

Note: The code includes detailed logging, file reading, data processing, and method calls to manage lipid entries and filter precursor ions for further analysis.
