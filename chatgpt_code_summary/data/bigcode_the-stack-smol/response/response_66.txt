This Python script defines functions and tests for electricity data processing using the premise library. It imports necessary data paths and creates a dummy database. The `get_db()` function returns the dummy database and a version number. An IAMDataCollection object is instantiated for data collection. The script sets up an Electricity object using the database and IAM data. Tests are defined to check losses, fuel lower heating values, power plant mapping, and emission mapping. It asserts conditions such as the length of losses, production volume for a specific region, the lower heating value for a fuel type, and checks on data types for power plant and emission mappings.
