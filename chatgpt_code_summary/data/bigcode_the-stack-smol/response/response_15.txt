The provided Python code creates a class `MoveItAddCollisionMesh` that adds a collision mesh to a planning scene using ROS (Robot Operating System). The class has a method `add_collision_mesh` to add a collision mesh synchronously and another method `add_collision_mesh_async` to add it asynchronously. The collision mesh is defined by a `compas_fab.robots.CollisionMesh` object. The `apply_planning_scene` service is used to apply the changes to the planning scene. The code sets up the necessary data structures and messages to add the collision mesh to the planning scene in a ROS environment.
