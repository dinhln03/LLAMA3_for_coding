The provided Python code implements a data structure called SetOfStacks that manages a set of stacks where each stack has a predefined limit of 2 items. The code defines methods to pop items from the top of the stack, push items to the top of the stack, check if the structure is empty, and peek at the top item without removing it. The script includes tests for these methods to ensure proper functionality. To use this code, instantiate SetOfStacks and then push, pop, peek, or check if it's empty as needed using the defined methods.
