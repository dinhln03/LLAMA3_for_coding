The code implements a Gaussian filter algorithm for image processing in Python. It includes functions to generate a Gaussian kernel matrix based on a given size and standard deviation, and to apply the filter to an input grayscale image. The image is convolved with the kernel matrix to perform blurring. The main script reads an image, converts it to grayscale, applies the Gaussian filter with different mask sizes (3x3 and 5x5), and displays the resulting images. The Gaussian filter helps in reducing noise and smoothing images. The code leverages libraries like OpenCV and NumPy for image manipulation and mathematical operations.
