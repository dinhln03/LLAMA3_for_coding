This Python script defines a function called 'add_data_for_name' to manage data for the babyname project. The function updates a dictionary of name data by adding or updating ranks associated with specific years for given names. The script also includes test functions (test1, test2, test3, test4) to demonstrate the functionality of the 'add_data_for_name' function. Running the script with command-line arguments 'test1', 'test2', 'test3', or 'test4' executes the respective test cases. The script reads command-line arguments to decide which test function to run. Each test function modifies the name data dictionary according to the predefined scenarios.
