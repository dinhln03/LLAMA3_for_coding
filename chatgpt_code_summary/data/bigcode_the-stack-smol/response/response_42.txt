This Python script provides utility functions for inverting an image back to a latent code using the StyleGAN model. The `StyleGANInverter` class allows for optimizing the latent code through gradient descent, considering various loss functions like pixel-wise reconstruction, perceptual loss, and regularization loss. The code includes functions for preprocessing images, obtaining initial latent codes, inverting images to latent codes, diffusing target images into context images, and convenient wrappers for these processes. The script leverages torch, OpenCV, and custom model classes for StyleGAN components, facilitating image inversion and manipulation tasks in a deep learning context.
