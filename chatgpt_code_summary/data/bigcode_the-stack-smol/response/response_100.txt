This Python script defines a ConfigurationPlugin class that includes various tasks. The plugin allows setting choices for certain tasks and provides help text for each task. The Test class contains test methods to validate the help texts and task functionalities. The script uses unittest.mock to simulate user input and output. The main function executes the script using the yaz library. Upon execution, it shows the documentation for each task, handles task parameters, and validates predefined choices. The script aims to demonstrate the usage of yaz library for creating configurable plugins with detailed task documentation and testing functionality.
