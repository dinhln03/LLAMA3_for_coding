This Python script provides functions for creating GCE container (Docker) deployments. It handles tasks like generating user-init metadata, updating instance metadata, managing container mounts, creating YAML manifests, and more. The code includes functions for validating metadata, selecting COS images, parsing port mappings, and updating container environment variables. It also defines constants, error classes, and helper functions for managing GCE container deployments. Ensure relevant metadata keys aren't conflicting, update containers with specified parameters, and clean up container mounts and environment variables effectively according to user input.
