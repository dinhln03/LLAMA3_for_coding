This Python script defines a Flask Blueprint for handling requests related to a 'ptboard'. It includes functions to validate a token used in the request and retrieve data from a database based on specified parameters. The script sanitizes and processes user input such as search terms, time ranges, order preferences, and site filters. It also interacts with a MySQL database to fetch records based on the provided criteria, including filtering and sorting. Certain values have default fallbacks if not provided. Additionally, it contains logic to modify response data, such as converting links for certain sites. Caching mechanisms are utilized, and the final response is formatted as JSON.
