This Python script demonstrates the creation and manipulation of raw transactions in a Bitcoin network test environment. Here's a concise summary of the script:

1. The code initializes a test framework for Bitcoin transactions.
2. It sets up a network with 4 nodes and connects them.
3. The script generates blocks and syncs all nodes.
4. Various tests are run to create, fund, decode, and verify raw transactions with different inputs and outputs.
5. Tests are conducted for transactions with different numbers of inputs and outputs, including multisig transactions.
6. The script handles scenarios such as testing fee calculations, invalid inputs, locked wallets, and transactions with multiple inputs.
7. It also tests transactions with specific scenarios like OP_RETURN, watch-only addresses, and using the entirety of watched funds.
8. Finally, the script evaluates fees and conducts various transaction signing and sending operations.

The script serves as a comprehensive test suite for various raw Bitcoin transactions, verifying their functionality and accuracy within the test network.
