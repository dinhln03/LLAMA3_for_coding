This Python script sets up a configuration for memory profiling tests using the LLVM Lit testing tool. It includes functionality to handle command line arguments, define compiler flags, and set environment variables. The script determines platform-specific memory profiling options, compiler flags for memory profiling, and necessary features for the tests. It also configures compiler commands, test suffixes, and environment variables for dynamic runtime libraries. The script ensures compatibility with Linux, sets test parallelism options, and handles essential configurations for memory profiling tests using LLVM Lit.
