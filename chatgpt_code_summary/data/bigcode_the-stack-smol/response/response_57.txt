This Python script defines a web crawler using Scrapy to extract information from a specific website ('fsx.sxxz.gov.cn'). The crawler navigates through the website following predefined rules and extracts content from different pages. It utilizes SplashRequest for JavaScript rendering and Selenium for web scraping. The extracted data includes URLs, dates, titles, and contents of articles. The parsing method 'parse_item' scrapes the content based on specified XPaths, handling different HTML structures. In case of exceptions, it tries alternative XPaths to extract the required data. This code snippet demonstrates web scraping techniques for extracting structured data from web pages.
