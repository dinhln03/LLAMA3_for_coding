This Python code demonstrates manipulating GPflow models. It includes creating a simple GP regression model, viewing, getting, and setting parameters, handling constraints and trainable variables, changing the training status of parameters, applying priors to parameters, optimizing models, and building a new linear multiclass classification model. Key functionalities such as setting parameter values, fixing parameters, applying constraints, and optimizing models are explained with concise examples. The code showcases model initialization, parameter manipulation, setting constraints, and priors, as well as optimization techniques using GPflow. Additionally, it illustrates building a custom Bayesian model for linear multiclass classification.
