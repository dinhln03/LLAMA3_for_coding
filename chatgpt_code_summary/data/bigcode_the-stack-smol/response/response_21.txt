This Python script defines functions to handle setup and teardown tasks before and after testing scenarios based on a specified test type. It uses the subprocess and time modules to run commands in the system shell. The `before_scenario` function starts a process using 'make start' command when the TEST_TYPE is 'bdd' and sets up a root URL for testing. In the `after_scenario` function, it terminates the started process if the test type is 'bdd'. The TEST_TYPE is determined using the environment variable TEST_TYPE, defaulting to 'bdd' if not specified.
