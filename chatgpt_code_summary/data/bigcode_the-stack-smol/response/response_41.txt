This Python code defines a custom hook for EWAH Aircall integration, allowing data extraction in batches from the Aircall API. It includes functionalities like defining resources to extract, setting up authentication using API ID and token, and fetching data incrementally based on specified parameters like start and end dates. The hook supports pagination with a maximum page size of 50 records and provides a method to fetch data in batches with specified batch size and pause time between calls. The code ensures the batch size is within limits and yields data batches until the specified size is reached.
