This script defines a Python class `MyU3` that extends the functionality of the LabJack U3 data acquisition device. It includes methods to handle data acquisition tasks like retrieving RMS voltage values, averaging analog readings, and calculating duty cycles. The `getRMS` method calculates the Root Mean Square voltage of sampled data, `getAvg` averages analog readings across multiple sampling cycles, and `getDutyCycle` computes the duty cycle measured by a timer. The script continuously samples data from the U3 device, performs calculations, and prints the results. Make sure to install the required `u3` module to use this code effectively.
