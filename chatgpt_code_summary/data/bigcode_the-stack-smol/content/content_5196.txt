# Theory: Indexes

# There are several types of collections to store data in Python.
# Positionally ordered collections of elements are usually called
# sequences, and both lists and strings belong to them. EAch
# element in a list, as well as each character in a string, has an
# index that corresponds to its position. Indexes are used to
# access elements within a sequence. Indexing is zero-based, so if
# you see a person who counts from zero, you must have met a
# programmer.
