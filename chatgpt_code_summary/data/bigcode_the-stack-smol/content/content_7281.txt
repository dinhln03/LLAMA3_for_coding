pg8000
------

pg8000 is a Pure-Python interface to the PostgreSQL database engine.  It is \
one of many PostgreSQL interfaces for the Python programming language. pg8000 \
is somewhat distinctive in that it is written entirely in Python and does not \
rely on any external libraries (such as a compiled python module, or \
PostgreSQL's libpq library). pg8000 supports the standard Python DB-API \
version 2.0.

pg8000's name comes from the belief that it is probably about the 8000th \
PostgreSQL interface for Python."""
