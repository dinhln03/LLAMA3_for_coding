# Use of a pre-trained convnet : VGG16

# An effective approach to deep learning on small image dataset is to leverage a pre-trained network
# A saved network trained on a large dataset for classification task. 
# -> ImageNet (1.4 million labeled images and 1000 different classes),VGG, ResNet, INception, Xception, etc...

# Part 1-Take the convolutional base of a previous trained network and running the data throught it 
# Part 2- Train a new classifier on top of the output 

# Why not reuse the classifier on the top? 
# ->The representation learned by the classifier is specific to the set of classes the model was trained on.
# ->The densely connected layer no longer contain any information about where the object are located. 

# Representation extracted by specific convolution layers depends on the depth of the layer in the model 
# layers that comes earlier in the model extract generic feature maps : edges, lolor, textures 
# layers higher-up extract abstract concepts : cat ear, dog eye. 




# Part 1-Take the convolutional base of a previous trained network
